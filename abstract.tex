This is a paper about the brains of the LSST scheduler (the feature based scheduler), how it works, how we've determined the survey strategy, and how well we expect the survey strategy to do in reaching the LSST survey goals. It will also cover how we evaluate the survey strategy during operations, on yearly, monthly and daily timescales.
