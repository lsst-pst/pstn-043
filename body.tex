\section{Introduction}


\section{Overview of Telescope Scheduling}
Summary of the general requirements for LSST scheduling (autonomous, reconfigurable, responsive to conditions, etc)
this section should show what the problem was that we were trying to solve

\section{Survey Strategy Goals}
Tag: Lynne
SRD goals, science goals .. overview and reference other material, but this section should show what we're trying to do for our survey 

\section{LSST Survey Simulator}
Tag: Tiago
Environment for testing the scheduler - weather and telescope model. And how they'll be used in operations too. 

\section{LSST Scheduler}
Tag: Peter
How does the scheduler work? What IS that double rainbow thing in the sky? 
What is the general idea? 
\subsection{Surveys and Basis functions}
What are we balancing in the scheduler for most observations?
\subsection{Scripted surveys}
What do we do when it's more specific?

\section{LSST Survey Strategy}
Tag: Lynne
How we've configured the scheduler to achieve our goals. How well we think we'll do answering all the astronomy questions.
\subsection{Process for determining best strategy}
Metrics and community and SCOC and SAC
\subsection{Adjusting survey strategy}
How can we adjust the strategy if it doesn't seem to be working or we change our goals?


\section{Verification??}
Does the separate Verification During Commissioning paper exist (or should it?) Should that go here?

\section{Conclusions}
